The "check-password-strength" project is a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords based on several criteria. It assesses various aspects of a password, including its length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

 Functionality:
1. **Password Length**: It checks if the password length meets a minimum requirement (in this case, 8 characters).
2. **Uppercase Letters**: It verifies if the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
3. **Lowercase Letters**: It checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
4. **Numbers**: It ensures the presence of at least one numeric character in the password.
5. **Special Characters**: It confirms if the password contains at least one special character from a predefined set (`!@#$%^&*()-+=`).

 Strength Assessment:
- The script provides feedback to the user based on the evaluation of the password.
- If any of the criteria are not met, the password is considered "Weak", and the specific requirement(s) not fulfilled are highlighted.
- If all criteria are satisfied, the password is deemed "Strong", indicating it meets the necessary security standards.

 Usage:
- Users run the script and are prompted to input their desired password.
- After entering the password, the script evaluates its strength according to the defined criteria.
- The user receives immediate feedback regarding the strength of their password.

Purpose:
- This project serves as a simple tool for users to quickly assess the strength of their passwords.
- It educates users about password security best practices by highlighting the essential aspects of a strong password.
- By encouraging users to create stronger passwords, it contributes to enhancing overall cybersecurity awareness and practices.
